Weekly Meeting 11/4
5-5:16 pm

Jen reminded us to check the rubric to make sure we're meeting
all of these requirements. Any code that's demoing is coming from 
main branch. AKA just merge into main everytime you made big commits.
Had Cole demo what we have so far, then Addie pulled up our project board.
Then went around the room and explained what we did:

Zandra
	- Worked on a general design idea for how we want the home page to look
	- Specifically the path process
	- Will be working on finalizing the design components and figuring out
	how to implement those into our website
Addie
	- Did the start of the database so it saves account data for user and password
	- Also did workout database to save specific muscle groups
	- Started today for the basic achievements page
	- Plans to do more on that front over the next few days
Keira
	- Worked on the functionality of the nav bar, also added titles to main
	pages to make sure I know when the nav bar is working we’ll
	- Also started basis for the header
	- Over the next few days plans on finalizing the functionality and 
	general design of the header
	- Extra Note: header willl be partially blank because we're waiting
	on some design aspects of logo/streak symbol to get that done fully
Cole
	- Base template for calendar page
	- Working on making it more dynamic
	- Also is starting the workouts page, designing a bit more
	- Will be working with Zandra on the logo 
Dalton
	- Started with the login and register page
	- Did the index.js and docker compose files for use of testing
	- Plans to work on the funcitonality of login page, make it fully
	functional

Jen Pointers
	- Save logo work until later on when we don't have other priorities

Random Notes
	- In general, great progress
	- Keep chugging along and make sure to prioritize functionality of
	the site before nitpicking on design aspects
