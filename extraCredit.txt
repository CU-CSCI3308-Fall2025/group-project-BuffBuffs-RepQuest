Extra Credit:
Identify at least five potential risks related to your project. 
For each risk, describe its severity and outline suitable mitigation strategies to address it

Risk 1:
One potential risk is path/quest based, so users could potentially beat the game. 
This issue is not severe for the implications of the project, but is severe if we have actual users 
because it would force us to lose our most loyal customers, once they beat the game. I propose to combat this, 
we create an function that goes to infinity to create achievements and plans, 
so that users may never run our of quests to complete.
