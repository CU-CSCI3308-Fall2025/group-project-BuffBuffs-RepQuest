Extra Credit:
Identify at least five potential risks related to your project. 
For each risk, describe its severity and outline suitable mitigation strategies to address it

Risk 1:
One potential risk is path/quest based, so users could potentially beat the game. 
This issue is not severe for the implications of the project, but is severe if we have actual users 
because it would force us to lose our most loyal customers, once they beat the game. I propose to combat this, 
we create an function that goes to infinity to create achievements and plans, 
so that users may never run our of quests to complete.

Risk 2:
Another potential risk is more so on the development side in terms of what our scope as a group is.
It's easy to fall into a trap of wanting to commit to certain features for our website and overestimating
the four weeks we have to complete this. One thing I think we should focus on to maybe help prevent this is 
dialing in on a good outline for what we're going to get done and catering it to the time we have available, 
accounting for classes we may also have work/studying for. Getting a good, reasonable expectation is something
that isn't on the forefront of people's mind during our first software development project,
but can prevent a lot of stress later on. 

Risk 3:
A potential risk thats more on the communication side is the possibility of running into issues with not 
communicating if things have been done/completed. I think that its very important to keep each other updated on 
individual progress so that we can continue to stay on track. If we don't then we leave the potential for gaps 
in our project and the inability to move forward if we are waiting to know if things have been completed or not, 
especially when we have certain deadlines to meet. In order to prevent this, I think that every time each member has 
completed something within the repository, we update each other so we know where everything is at and how to keep 
moving forward to reach our goal.
